### Loading RHVoice library and use in python code.

Generate speech stream from text without re-initializing engine.
This very fast and more convenient than call RHVoice-test. Off the shelf supports wav, mp3 and opus.

Tested on python 3.6 in Linux and Windows 10.

Example usage https://github.com/Aculeasis/rhvoice-rest/blob/master/app.py
